# Contribute Guidelines

First off, Thank you for considering your contribute in this project!
This document has the rule of PRs, issues, and discussions.


## Make a Issue
To reduce the burden on maintainers, please fill out the provided form as completely as possible. If the form is not fully completed, it may delay the maintainer's investigation.

## Make a Feature Request
Feature requests are always welcome! Please let us know about the feature you desire. If there are any documents explaining the feature or other tools that have implemented it, please provide those as references.

## Make a Pull requests
Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure that the functionality works with at least SQLite, MySQL, and Postgres databases. Use sample databases provided by the respective database sites to set up these databases on your localhost (note that SQLite may not have an official sample database).

In Pull Requests, linters, formatters, and tests are run automatically. Currently, the test coverage is low, so if you find it difficult to write tests, you may open a Pull Request without tests initially.

## About Future Plan
This project is a fork of `gobang`, but it is also a product that kyoto7250 forked for personal use. Depending on future developments of Gobang, this project may either be merged back into the original or continue independently. Currently, I have not decided how the development will proceed.
